## 🌟 Avatar Golden Age Website — README

### 🧙‍♂️ Chosen Character: Avatar Aang

This landing page was created as part of an assignment requiring the selection of a character from the "Golden Age" phase of their life.

The character chosen is **Avatar Aang**. While Aang is originally portrayed as a young Air Nomad, his unique timeline—having been frozen in an iceberg for 100 years—means that when he awakens, he is already biologically over a century old. This inherently qualifies him as belonging to the "Golden Age" category, both in age and narrative.

Additionally, the website is written from the perspective of an older Aang, post-series, with full awareness of the events of both *Avatar: The Last Airbender* and *The Legend of Korra*. In the sequel series, Aang is referred to as a historical figure of great influence, further anchoring the project in the intended timeframe.

> **Note:** The entire site is written in first-person, adopting the tone of Avatar Aang himself — as if he were presenting the content directly to the visitor.
