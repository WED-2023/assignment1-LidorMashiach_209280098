    <h2>About the Avatar</h2>
    <p>     <!-- Opening paragraph - a concrete explanation of why Avatar Aang is considered the Golden Age -->
      Hi there! I'm Aang â€” an Airbender, a vegetarian, and... well, the Avatar.
      <br>I was born in the Southern Air Temple, raised by monks, and trained in the ancient ways of Air Nomads.
      <br>I may look like a 66-year-old airbender enjoying retirement, but don't let that fool you â€” <b>I'm actually 166 years old</b>
      <br>Long story short: I got frozen in a giant iceberg for about a hundred years. It happens.
      <br>When I woke up, the world had changed â€” the Fire Nation had started a war, and my people, the Air Nomads, were gone.
      <br>To this day, <b>I'm the last Airbender</b>.
    </p>

    <p> <!-- The role of the Avatar -->
      <br>As the Avatar, I have the unique ability to bend all four elements: <span class="icons">air<img src ="Icons/Air_Nation_Icon.png" alt="Air Nation Icon">, water<img src ="Icons/Water_Nation_Icon.jpg" alt="Water Nation Icon">, earth<img src ="Icons/Earth_Nation_Icon.jpg" alt="Earth Nation Icon">, fire<img src ="Icons/Fire_Nation_Icon.jpg" alt="Fire Nation Icon"></span>.
      <br>My job is to maintain balance in the world â€” between people, nations, and nature itself.
      <br>It's not always easy... but <b>I believe peace is always possible</b >. Violence isn't the answer.
    </p>

    <p><!-- The abilities of the Avatar -->
      <br>But being the Avatar isn't just about bending elements.
      <br>I'm also the bridge between the physical world and the Spirit World.
      <br>I carry the wisdom and experiences of all my past lives â€” Avatars who came before me, like Avatar Roku and Avatar Kyoshi.
      <br>When I enter the Avatar State, I can channel their power and knowledge, and sometimes even speak with the dead.
      <br>It's a heavy burden... but also a great honor.
    </p>

    <p><!-- The Avatar's family -->
      <br>I travel with my loyal flying bison, Appa, and my curious little lemur, Momo.
      <br>They're more than pets â€” they're my family.
    </p>

    <p> <!-- The Avatar's hobbies -->
      <br>When I'm not out saving the world or gliding through the clouds, I enjoy the little things:
      <ul>
        <li> eating (a lot)</li>
        <li> meditating</li>
        <li> exploring ancient ruins </li>
        <li> meeting new friends </li>
        <li> occasionally playing a mean game of airball.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p><!-- The Avatar's close friends -->
      <br>Throughout my journey, I've been lucky to be surrounded by people who shaped who I am.
      <br>Here are some of the most important figures in my life:
      <ul>
        <li>Katara - a compassionate and powerful waterbender. She's the one who found me frozen in the iceberg and brought me back to the world. <br>She's also one of the greatest healers and bloodbenders alive â€” and more than just a friend.</li>
        <li>Sokka - her brother, a brilliant strategist, swordmaster, and boomerang expert. He proved that you don't need bending to change the world.</li>
        <li>Toph - the toughest earthbender you'll ever meet, and she's blind. No big deal.</li>
        <li>Zuko - once my enemy, now one of my closest allies. To bring peace, you also have to learn how to forgive.</li>
        <li>Avatar Roku - my previous incarnation. He taught me a lot... and gave me headaches.</li>
        <li>Guru Pathik - the one who helped me open my chakras (well... almost all of them).</li>
        <li>Monk Gyatso - my mentor, my teacher, and like a father to me.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p> <!-- Closing paragraph -->
      <br>Eventually, things did calm down. The war ended, the nations began to heal, and I even started a family.
      <br>My son, Tenzin, went on to become a great airbending master.
      <br>If you want to know more about what happened next... you'll have to visit the <i>Legend of Korra</i> section of the Spirit Library.

    <p>
      Sky bison are gentle, loyal, and 100% fluffy.  
      Every click helps keep them airborne (and well-fed).  
      Appa says: <i>"Yip yip for a like!"</i>
